## What does this do?

This is a plugin for the Bizhawk Shuffler 2. It allows you to temporarily add games into the game list and add those games in again after they've been marked "completed."

When I made it, I was thinking it would be used for donation incentives. For example, if your community donates $X dollars, you have to add one loop of Donkey Kong for the NES to your shuffler. This plugin helps you manage your "temporary," incentivized games.

## How do I use this?

TLDR:

1) Extract into your Shuffler's plugins folder
2) Put your Temporary Games into the storage folder
3) Enable the Plugin
4) Trigger/Activate the plugin -- See below for more
5) Mark the game as complete to remove it from the game list.
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 as needed.

If you need more help, see the Getting Started link below.


## Trigger Files

TLDR: Create a file with the same filename (or the same filename plus .txt) as your TempGood game in the `restore` directory. E.G. if you want to take `Donkey Kong.nes` out of your TempGoods storage, create a file named `Donkey Kong.nes` or `Donkey Kong.nes.txt` in your `restore` directory.
